        title:"What's a Bonsai",
        paragraph:"Bonsai could be translated to “tray planting”, and is the Japanese art of growing and training miniature trees in containers, developed from the traditional Chinese art form of penjing. Penjing and bonsai differ in that, the former, attempts to display “wilder” more naturalistic scenes, often representing landscapes, including elements such as water, rocks or figurines; on the other hand, bonsai typically focuses on a single tree or a group of trees of the same species, with a higher level of aesthetic refinement. Similar versions of the art exist in other cultures, including the miniature living landscapes of Vietnamese Hòn non bộ. It was during the Tang dynasty, when penjing was at its height, that the art was first introduced in Japan."

That's why All our plants are picked and shipped from our own nursery. Because of this, we can ensure that each plant meets our standards of care and quality prior to shipping.

        paragraph:"As we have stated before presentation is of utmost importance when referring to Bonsai. So if you are planing to gift a Bonsai you can add a note which arrives in a recycled sealed envelope. We also use our own proprietary custom boxes and packaging for shipping bonsai trees and plants. The result is a great looking gift the moment you open the top of the box."
